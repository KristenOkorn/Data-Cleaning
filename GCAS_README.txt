 Description: This data file contains GCAS NO2 slant column densities in molecules/cm^2 derived at a single spatial resolution using measured spectra obtained during the Discover-AQ B200 flights of July/Aug., 2014.'
    ' ------Revision history-----------'    '
 Release 0 (R0): Initial data release - Jan. 30th, 2015.'
 Release 1 (R1): Nov 1st, 2018'
 - Fixed geolocation error (missing roll,pitch,yaw) on flight days July 17th and 20th'
 - Changed to single reference location corresponding to a Pandora site coincidence, Sept. 24th @15.810778 UTC, 39.5345N, -105.070W'
 Release 2 (R2): Nov 23rd, 2020' -Added total column (VCD) outputs'
    ' Public release, no restrictions on usage.'    '
 ---------------------------------'    ' Method:'    '
 Absolute nadir radiances are measured and aggregated to 21 cross-track positions of approximately 250 m x 350 m GSD size.'
    '
 Note: Sample areas are approximate given typical flight altitudes and ground speed.'
    '
 Each average sample spectrum is calibrated using a reference spectrum which is itself an average under clear-sky conditions during minimum solar zenith angle periods. A reference for all days was obtained using a 5 minute average during a Pandora overpass on Sept. 24th.'
    '
 Reference time, location: 39.5345 degN, -105.070 degW, 15.810778 hours UTC +/- 2.5 minute average'
    '
 The result is analyzed in specific spectral windows to retrieve the molecular absorption using Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy techniques [1]. The software packagedeveloped at the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BIRA-IASB) WinDOAS [2] is used to fit cross-section data to log-normalized spectra.'
    '
 Average minimum sensitivities (rms fit residual equivalent slant column absorption) for the various product are [x1E16 molecules/cm^2]'

 The NO2_VCD_BelowAircraft variable is expected to be the most useful quantity for validation purposes, comparison to in-situ aircraft profiles, and ground based PANDORA measurements. Care should be taken with any use of the diagnostic variables (NO2_VCD_AboveAircraft, NO2_AMF_BelowAircraft, and NO2_AMF_AboveAircraft) as they do not have simple relationships between each other or with the final below aircraft VCD. For a full explanation of how these variables are calculated please see:'

 Note2: Vertical column estimated uncertainties statement:'    '
 The overall error budget of NO2 VCDs below the aircraft is comprised of errors in differential NO2 SCDs and AMFs. The estimated uncertainty in the differential SCD is 1.1\xc3\x971015 molec. cm-2. The AMF errors arise from uncertainty in a-priori NO2 profile shapes and in the parameters that affect the scattering weights as discussed in Section 3.2.2. of the JGR article. Since our interest is cloud-free GeoTASO observations, we neglect the uncertainties arising from cloud parameters (cloud pressure and cloud radiance fraction) that can also affect scattering weights. The AMF uncertainty from the GeoTASO viewing geometry is negligible. Our analysis shows that the overall error in individual NO2 VCD below aircraft, derived through propagation of errors, is estimated to be 31%.'
